I've been doing all of my analysis in R.  This is what I have so far.  Do you guys think we should do a train and test set, 
or just write our report on odds ratios and stuff for the entire data set?

Mostly I've been playing around with the variables after looking at predictors in the full model.

I also ran a lasso model to try to get an idea what subset might be best but I'm not sure if its right or we should include it.
